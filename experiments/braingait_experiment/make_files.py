# run file is a tsv file containing: task_name: Name of the task - task_code:
# short name of the task - task_file: Name of the task file for this run -
# instruction_dur: Duration of the instruction screen before the task starts (in seconds)
# - start_time: Start time of the task (in seconds from the start of the run)
# - end_time: End time of the task (in seconds)

# Task Files Task files that specify the structure of the tasks within each
# run (e.g. the stimuli, the correct response, whether to display feedback,
# etc.).
#
# The task file can look very different, but typically  contains some of the
# following columns:
# trial_num: Trial number
# hand: Hand used for the task (left or right)
# trial_dur: Duration of the trial (in seconds)
# iti_dur: Inter-trial interval duration (in seconds)
# stim: Stimulus presented
# display_trial_feedback: Whether to display feedback after each trial
# start_time: Start time of the trial (in seconds)
# end_time: End time of the trial (in seconds)
# Key columns, for example in the case of four response keys (e.g. in the
# RMET task or Finger Sequence task): - key_one: Key for the first option -
# key_two: Key for the second option - key_three: Key for the third option -
# key_four: Key for the fourth option
# some of the tasks require run number because the stimuli depend on the run
# number (e.g., movie clips have a specific order for each run)
